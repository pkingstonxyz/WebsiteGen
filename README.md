The generator files for my website pkingston.xyz

## What this is
These files are the scripts I use to generate my website. There is a focus on functionality over form.

***I know that this is poorly written code***

I wrote all of this code in the span of ~1hr as a means to get my website up and running. I am a big fan of antiquated web design (ugly) principles. I have a sort of nostalgia for this era of the web that I only caught the tail end of. This code is pretty bad, but it does its job for my purposes, so I have no reason to change it.
